# Let's go to the Park!
This is the third project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. It was developped by a group of 3 students in a time frame of 3.5 days.
The MVP requirements are as follow:
- Full stack application using our own database and API.
- A CRUD application, with the hability to log in and log out the users.
- Deployment on Heroku.

## :page_facing_up: About
Let's go to the Park is an app focused in displaying information about the parks in South Australia.
The user can check all relevant informations about the parks, such as: address, facilities, parking, prices, if it's pet friendly, etc.
On the Home Page, the user can either log in or sign up to be able to see the app content.
Only registered users are able to edit and add new parks.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- We first started planning how we would build the app and the minimun requirements for the project.
- Then, we created boards on Trello for each member to add their to-do list, labelled accordingly.
- The main goal was to deliver the Minimun Viable Product, and work on extra features if we had the time to do so. 
- When the MVP was achieved, we decided to add a Bing Map as extra feature to our project.

- Using GitHub as a team is a lot different than using it for personal projects! This project was a great opportunity to learn how to use GitHub in a collaborative environment.
- Planning was essential to keep us on track.
- Clear and effective communication between the members of group is the key to avoid conflicts and errors.

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Add a search bar with filter so the users can search for specific parks according to its facilities.
- Add a feature to enable the users to rate and review the parks.
